// The glide: one highlight plate per cluster of flat controls, slid between them
// instead of each control flashing its own background. A container opts in with
// data-glide; nothing else is wired. Delegation on the document means clusters can
// appear, re-render, or vanish (Blazor owns the DOM) without any bookkeeping here —
// a plate that got diffed away is simply rebuilt on the next hover.
//
// Two flavours, same engine:
//
//   data-glide           a grey plate that appears under the pointer and leaves
//                        with it. For clusters where nothing is "current".
//   data-glide="marble"  the marble, in its iris outline. Follows the pointer the
//                        same way, but instead of vanishing it settles back onto
//                        whichever child carries data-glide-rest — the toolbar's
//                        selected window. A cluster with no resting child behaves
//                        like the plate and fades out.
//
// Measuring the target rather than stepping by a fixed column is what lets the
// toolbar hold tabs of different widths: a window called "Ops" has no business
// being as wide as one called "Boston Red Sox at Miami Marlins". The CSS-variable
// marble in lineops.css still drives the gate and the section tabs, where the
// positions genuinely are equal and no measuring is needed.
//
// Styling lives in lineops.css under "The glide".
