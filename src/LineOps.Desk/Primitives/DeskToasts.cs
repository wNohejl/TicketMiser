/// The desk's transient notice.
///
/// A toast is the quietest tier of feedback the console has: non-critical, auto-dismissing,
/// and recoverable elsewhere. It reports that something finished while the operator was
/// looking at something else. Anything that needs a decision, or that the operator must not
/// miss, stays inline in the panel where the decision is made — a toast that has scrolled
/// away cannot be acted on.
///
/// This type is the seam. Panels call <c>Toasts.Success(...)</c>; they never take
/// <c>ISnackbar</c>, never name a MudBlazor <c>Severity</c>, and never write a CSS class.
/// That keeps the call sites reviewable in the desk's own vocabulary — a notice states its
/// <see cref="DeskState"/>, the same name-the-state-not-the-colour rule a tag states — and it
/// leaves one place to change if the toast is ever rendered by something other than MudBlazor.
///
/// The state drives two things: which desk hue the notice wears (through
/// <c>SnackbarTypeClass</c>, styled in css/mud-bridge.css) and which icon MudBlazor picks
/// for it. Both come from the state, so a call site cannot get them out of step.
