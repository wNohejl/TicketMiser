/// The desk used to have a single "tone" vocabulary that both painted buttons and named
/// states. This is the half of it that was never about buttons. Hue stops being an
/// affordance channel — an interface with five coloured button types has no primary action,
/// only five competing ones — and moves to where states actually live: a figure, a tag, a
/// toast, the pulse strip. Those still need to say "this is healthy" or "this breached", and
/// they say it here.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// Hue is always the second channel, never the only one. A tag carries its word, a metric
/// carries its label and note, a toast carries its sentence — the state is legible with the
/// colour removed, and the colour only sharpens a reading that already works.

/// Buttons do not take a <c>DeskState</c>. They take <see cref="DeskEmphasis"/> and
/// <see cref="DeskRole"/>, because the question a button answers is how much weight it
