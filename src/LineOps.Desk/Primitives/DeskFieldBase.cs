/// <summary>
/// The mechanics every field shares, so the three call-site components stay thin.
///
/// A field is the key's inverse — cut into the panel, unlit, not pressable (ADR 0008).
/// The look is entirely <c>.field</c> in lineops.css and this class does not touch it;
/// what it adds is the part the hand-authored markup never had: a real label bound to
/// the control by id, a required mark, and a place for an error to sit next to the
/// field rather than somewhere else on the panel.
///
/// Two rules keep it honest at the call sites that already exist:
///
///   · <b>The frame is opt-in.</b> With no <see cref="Label"/> and no <see cref="Error"/>
///     the control renders bare — no wrapper element. Every field on the desk today is a
///     direct child of a <c>.row</c> flexbox carrying its own <c>flex</c>/<c>max-width</c>,
///     and quietly wrapping it in a div would move all of them. A frame appears only when
///     there is something to put in it.
///   · <b>The caller never loses an attribute, and never overwrites ours.</b> Blazor applies
///     a splat last, so an element that sets <c>class</c> itself and also splats hands any
///     caller passing <c>class</c> the power to erase it — the bug written up in
///     2026-08-26-gate-switch-and-glide-design.md, where an incoming <c>style</c> dropped
///     DeskSwitch's own custom properties and collapsed the control. Here every attribute is
///     merged into one dictionary in <see cref="Attributes"/> before rendering, so ordering
///     stops deciding anything: <c>class</c> and <c>style</c> are composed by the component,
///     and everything else the caller passes (placeholder, type, min, max, step, disabled)
///     lands untouched.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="TValue">
/// What the field holds. <c>string</c> needs no conversion; numeric and enum types round-trip
/// through <see cref="BindConverter"/> under the invariant culture, which is what Blazor's own
/// <c>@bind</c> does for <c>type="number"</c> and is therefore what the migrated call sites had.
